Here's an example of an equation using MathJax:
\\[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\]
made using latex syntax directly in the markdown document...
``` 
\\[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\]
``` 
And here is that same equation, \\( f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\), inline with this text.
